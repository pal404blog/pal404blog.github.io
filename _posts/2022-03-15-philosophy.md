### Philosophy for beginners: an introduction to the basics of philosophical thought.


Philosophy is the study of the fundamental nature of knowledge, reality, and existence. It is an oldest and most comprehensive of all intellectual disciplines. Philosophers ask the biggest questions in life, such as: what is the meaning of life? What is the nature of reality? What is the best way to live? And what is the relationship between the mind and the body?

Philosophy is not a science, because it does not rely on empirical evidence. Rather, it is a form of critical thinking, in which philosophers use reason and logic to examine arguments and theories. This can involve asking questions such as: is this argument valid? Is this claim true? And how do we know?

Philosophy can be divided in to three main branches: metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics.
