Cryptocurrencies are all the rage lately. With Bitcoin prices reaching all-time highs, and new Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) popping up every day, it’s hard to miss the fervor around digital currencies.

But should we all be jumping on the cryptocurrency bandwagon?

Here are four reasons why we should all hate cryptocurrencies:

1. They’re a scam.

Most cryptocurrencies are not backed by anything tangible. They’re based on pure speculation, and many of them are simply scams designed to take advantage of gullible investors.

2. They’re unstable.

Cryptocurrencies are incredibly volatile. The value of Bitcoin, for example, has fluctuated by hundreds of dollars in a single day. This makes them a risky investment, and a poor store of value.

3. They’re a bubble.

Cryptocurrencies are in a massive bubble right now.


In web3, we trust

Recently, there's been a lot of buzz around web3. Many people are advocating for its widespread adoption, while others are warning of the dangers it poses. But what is web3, and why should we hate it?

Simply put, web3 is a new way of using the internet. It's based on a technology called blockchain, which is a distributed database that allows for secure, transparent and tamper-proof transactions. This makes it a perfect solution for online transactions, which is why it's being used to create a new internet called the "decentralized web".

The problem with web3 is that it's not really ready for mainstream adoption. The technology is still in its infancy, and there are a lot of kinks to be worked out. The user experience is also far from ideal, and it can be difficult to find reliable information about it.

Ultimately, web3 is a risky investment.
